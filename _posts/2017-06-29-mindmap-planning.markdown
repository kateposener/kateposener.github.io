Are we done? Are we ready to release? I find these questions very difficult to answer without sufficient information, as I'm sure most people do, and that it leads to a lack of confidence from a conscientious QA to say "Yes, I'm happy with that!".

As an advocate for agile software development, I prefer a light approach to documentation. That said, a little planning - which at the same time fosters discussion and thought - goes a very long way. 

If you haven't given mind mapping a go, try this out:
- grab a pen and paper
- sit down with someone knowledgable in the problem, and likely to be involved in creating the solution
- write the name of the feature in the middle of the page
- what are the main ways that you would slice up the story? e.g. what are the primary features? Use these as the initial branches.
- let your thoughts spider out... avoid the temptation to write lists! 
- I also find it useful to then note on the various elements of the map the level of testing that should be used to target it e.g. unit, API, UI
- get satisfaction as you implement tests and cross them off the map ;)

I don't think I've had a mind mapping session that I've felt was a waste of time. It's amazing how there are almost always interesting and useful discussions to be had about the problem, and so many more test cases to come out of this when two (or more) people chat about it together. Or if it's done "properly" - before coding begins - issues highlighted that might need addressing before the story is even started.

Most of us are in this business because we're problem solvers, and it's often surprisingly enjoyable to talk the problem through and see it become a useful visual representation.
